# webassembly-libc-example
This is a trivial example of compiling a C function that uses the C standard library to WebAssembly.

Note: To run the build script (in `package.json`), you need to download the [WASI SDK](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) (which includes Clang/LLVm) and extract it to a subdirectory named "wasi-sdk".
